\title{Calculate LOD penalties}

\description{
  Derive penalties for the penalized LOD scores (used by
  \code{\link{stepwiseqtl}}) on the basis of permutation results
  from a two-dimensional, two-QTL scan (obtained by \code{\link{scantwo}}).
}

\usage{calc.penalties(perms, alpha=0.05, lodcolumn)}

\arguments{
 \item{perms}{Permutation results from \code{\link{scantwo}}.}
 \item{alpha}{Significance level.}
 \item{lodcolumn}{If the scantwo permutation results contain LOD scores for
    multiple phenotypes, this argument indicates which to use in the
    summary.  This may be a vector.  If missing, penalties for all
 phenotypes are calculated.}
}

\details{
  Thresholds derived from \code{\link{scantwo}} permutations (that
  is, for a two-dimensional, two-QTL genome scan) are used to calculate
  penalties on main effects and interactions.  

  The main effect penalty is the 1-\code{alpha} quantile of the null
  distribution of the genome-wide maximum LOD score from a single-QTL
  genome scan (as with \code{\link{scanone}}).

  The "heavy" interaction penalty is the 1-\code{alpha} quantile of
  the null distribution of the maximum interaction LOD score (that is,
  the \eqn{\log_{10}}{log10} likelihood ratio comparing the best model
  with two interacting QTL to the best model with two additive QTL) from
  a two-dimensional, two-QTL genome scan (as with
  \code{\link{scantwo}}).

  The "light" interaction penality is the difference between the
  \code{"fv1"} threshold from the \code{\link{scantwo}}
  permutations (that is, the 1-\code{alpha} quantile of the LOD score
  comparing the best model with two interacting QTL to the best
  single-QTL model) and the main effect penalty.
}

\value{
  Vector of three values indicating the penalty on main
  effects and heavy and light penalties on interactions,
  or a matrix of such results, with each row corresponding to a
  different phenotype.
