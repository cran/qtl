\title{Identify the largest subset of markers that are some distance apart}

\description{
  Identify the largest subset of markers for which no two adjacent
  markers are separated by less than some specified distance; if weights
  are provided, find the marker subset for which the sum of the weights
  is maximized.
}

\usage{
pickMarkerSubset(locations, min.distance, weights)
}

\arguments{
 \item{locations}{A vector of marker locations.}
 \item{min.distance}{Minimum distance between adjacent markers in the
 chosen subset.}
 \item{weights}{(Optional) vector of weights for the markers.  If
 missing, we take \code{weights == 1}.}
}

\value{A vector of marker names.}


\details{
Let \eqn{d_i}{d[i]} be
the location of marker \eqn{i}, for \eqn{i \in 1, \dots, M}{i in 1,
\dots, M}.  We use the dynamic programming algorithm of Broman and Weber
(1999) to identify the subset of markers \eqn{i_1, \dots, i_k}{i[1], \dots,
i[k]} for which \eqn{d_{i_{j+1}} - d_{i_j} \le}{d(i[j+1]) - d(i[j]) <=}
\code{min.distance} and \eqn{\sum w_{i_j}}{sum w(i[j])} is maximized. 

If there are multiple optimal subsets, we pick one at random.
