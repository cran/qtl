\title{Convert a sex-specific map to a sex-averaged one.}

\description{
  Convert a sex-specific map to a sex-averaged one, assuming that the
  female and male maps are actually the same (that is, that the map was
  estimated assuming a common recombination rate in females and males).
}

\usage{
convert2sa(map, tol=1e-4)
}

\arguments{
 \item{map}{A map object with sex-specific locations (but assuming that
 the female and male maps are the same), as output by the function
 \code{\link{est.map}} for a 4-way cross, with argument
 \code{sex.sp=FALSE}.}
  \item{tol}{Tolerance value for inspecting the differences between the
 female and male maps; if they differ by more than this tolerance, a
 warning is issued.}
}

\value{
  A map object, with sex-averaged distances.  
}

\details{
  We pull out just the female marker locations, and give a warning if
  there are large differences between the female and male maps.
