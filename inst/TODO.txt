"To do" list for R/qtl
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This file is intended to contain a list of many of the additions and
revisions that are planned for the R/qtl package.  

If you any additions or revisions to suggest, please send an email to
Karl Broman, <kbroman@jhsph.edu>.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
SHORT TERM:

o Add an example regarding the X chromosome to the help files for
  fake.f2 and scanone.

o Update the tutorial, especially regarding the revisions of the
  ripple function and the X chromosome. (Also, the new stuff Hao
  added.) 

o Deal with the X chromosome appropriately in fitqtl, makeqtl and
  scanqtl. 

o est.map(trace=TRUE) giving weird values on Mac?

o Need to modify the map expansion for RI lines for the X chromosome.

o Rescale LOD score for X chromosome in scanone/two? 

o Coefficient estimates by imputation in fitqtl.

o MIM for a set of QTLs at specified locations with specified
  interactions (as a new method in fitqtl and scanqtl).


MEDIUM TERM:

o Deal with the X chromosome appropriately in scantwo with method="em"

o Include P-values for hypothesis tests in results in geno.table

o max.scanqtl, summary.scanqtl, print.summary.scanqtl, plot.scanqtl

o Panels of effect plots along a chromosome.

o Modify plot.rf and plot.errorlod to allow plot of a color scale, as
  in plot.scantwo.  

o Allow for the possibility of weights of individuals in scanone and
  scantwo. 

o In MIM: allow return of SEs of effects.  Write coef.mim, resid.mim,
  and dev.mim to pull out the est'd coefficients, the residuals, and
  the "deviance" (2 * ln likelihood).

o In MIM, refinement of QTL location and plots of that.

o calc.genoprob and sim.geno for "f2ss" (intercross with sex-specific
  maps) 


LONG TERM:

o Data conversion functions to/from Chuck Berry's bqtl package

o subset.scanone, subset.scantwo

o Add appropriate functions to analyze advanced intercrosses. 

o Model search for MIM etc.

o Function to plot, for a specified q1, LOD{q2|q1} vs q2 (using the
  output from scantwo).

o Take the fit of the null model outside of the C code for
  the imputation method in scanone and scantwo, so that it
  only has to be done once (rather than for each chr or chr pair).

o Starting values for EM for the two-part model (and more generally).
  Allow the option of an automatic selection of multiple starting
  points. 

o Generalized linear models in scanone and scantwo.

o Analysis functions such as scanone and scantwo might assign an
  attribute to their output which identifies the input data and/or
  function call.

o Re-write the C code for EM underneath scanone and scantwo so that it
  is not so tedious.

o Wrappers for Brian Yandell's bmapqtl software to do QTL mapping by
  MCMC. 

o Individual numbers in plot.geno function; allow it to plot only
  individuals with apparent genotyping errors, with a mix of
  chromosomes.
